            <p>Hello, I am Aaron James, a member of the Macaulay Honors college class of 2028 and  a Computer Science major, considering a second major/minor in Game Design. I got started in Computer Science because I wanted to learn how to make video games. I have been playing them for as long as I can remember- according to my mother it started because of my sister putting me on Roblox at 18 months old. In high school it evolved from a love of video games to a love of programming and the problem solving challenges it presents. Though I did tie in video games, and ended up making games for two english projects and a math project, on top of the game development class I took in senior year.</p>
           <br />
            <p>My hope is that I can find a career after I get my bachelors degree. I am open to doing a masters in Computer Science, but I prefer  the more practical side of programming like software engineering in a workplace then the theoretical side that is computer science academia. I’m also interested in getting work experience as a game developer. I know that I like it as a hobby but I want to know if I would enjoy being a game developer full time. </p>
           <br />
            <p>Writing is useful in my career because software engineers write a lot of documentation. This past summer I had an internship opportunity at Bloomberg. On my team of 7, we had one person whos jobs it was solely to write user facing documentation, which requires writing skill and the technical skill to understand what the code is doing. Other than user facing docs, everyone had to write internal docs, including steps to fix any issues that cropped up, or in my case documenting the changes i made and my testing processes. Software engineers often lean onto written communication, as you don’t know if someone will be using your tool tomorrow or in ten years, but you need to be able to support them anyway.</p>
           <br />
            <p>At any point in time, a reading app (or a web browser I use mainly for reading) is the most used app on my phone. One day my reading app at the time (firefox) had twelve hours of screen time. It started with translated Japanese light novels and web novels, then western and Chinese web novels, until about two years ago I started reading fanfiction. Because of these influences, the definition of good writing to me is really just does it follow proper grammar. A story is in the hands of the author, and rather then something being ‘good’ it’s more accurate to say that I don’t like it. For technical writing I would want it to be clear, concise and actually get the information across.</p>
           <br />
            <p>I feel most confident writing essays, poems and short stories. To tie this in with the following question, my biggest issue is my writing stamina. I tend to be concise, and once I have all my ideas out on paper I struggle with increasing word count. The one time I tried long form creative writing in the form of a web novel, I ended up with a chapter that was 300 words long and I couldn’t figure out how to expand. While it would be fine to turn in as a short story, this was my first attempt at writing actual long form content. To see it not even reach the level of words I would want to read in a chapter was disheartening. My first college essay was a similar story. I wanted to write about my personal growth, but while writing it not only was I personally uninterested in the essay, the entire thing seemed too contrived. I took a step back, thought about what was important to me, and in the end I got into most of my colleges (besides MIT) by writing about game development, and I got into Macaulay by talking about my social anxiety in the context of running Dungeons and Dragons. To summarize, the skill I want to work on this semester is writing stamina.
