            <div className="p-3"><p>Dear Hiring Manager,</p>
            <br />
            <p></p>
            <p>In the past 4 years, I have done much work on games in the form of personal and school projects. Through those projects I gained experience with the Unity, Godot, and Unreal Engine. I also learned about using their respective programming languages, C# (twice), GDScript, at C++. Beforehand I already had academic experience with Java and object oriented programming. Other projects have given me experience in web, api, and app development.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>n my internship at Bloomberg, I gained experience with software engineering best practices. I learned the importance and implementation of unit testing, how to interact with Continuous integration and deployment (ci/cd) systems, and got used to working in an agile development environment using scrum processes. I took responsibility for a project, building and presenting an internal tool to help increase developer efficiency. Through my interactions with senior engineers and team leads I learned about different phases and roles in the SDLC</p>
        <p>I would like to meet to discuss my potential impact on the quality of your games and the experiences of your players as part of your intern program. Thank you for taking the time to read this letter.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Thank you for your considering, Aaron James</p></div>
