                <p>Through this Job Packet, I did a lot more critical thinking about the job search/application process. While before I just looked for jobs without really thinking about what exactly the company did/does, in the packet I did a deep dive and analysis on both the company and the position. In doing this, I explored learning objectives 7 and 8, finding and using sources. We also started on learning objective 4, as we had to adapt our writing to different forms of communication and rhetorical situations.

                <p>I think the most challenging portion of this process is formatting my resume. Almost every where you will see advice about not having your resume go past a single page. I was lucky in this, because I had an already existing resume that I just had to update with recent experiences and projects. Still, it caused trouble putting it into the packet, so it is also included separately. Another issue with the resume was that I had to include my major in it, which I forgot originally. This increased the number of lines, meaning I needed to cut more then I had originally.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>My takeaway from the packet was just how lucky I got to get my first internship, because I had no idea just how much actually goes into applying to jobs. My first application consisted of 2 weeks of work on my resume, and about 2 hours of work on a cover letter. It made me realize that there was so much more I could and should’ve done when applying for Bloomberg, including learning what Bloomberg actually does.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>Partially because of the sheer  amount of time I spent formatting it, I am really proud of how my resume turned out. It shows a lot of my experience through both jobs/work experience, and my projects. I think it shows just how dedicated I am to programming, and it reminds of just how much I’ve done in such a short time.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                In conclusion, this job packet is particularly helpful for me as it gives me the framework to apply to this job in the future. It also helped me understand how to write a cover letter, and how to sell myself better. It also forced me to think more about my career goals and to update my resume to make sure it’s up to date.
