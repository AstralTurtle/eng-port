            <p>Hi, I'm Aaron James. I'm a gamer, game dev, and software engineer. I'm a student of the Macaulay Honors College at CCNY. I've previously interned at Bloomberg, and have some experience making games using godot and unity, including many game jams. I love playing league of legends and valorant, and was wondering about a potential internship opportunity this summer at Riot Games. Would you be able to give me your email or linkedin to discuss this further?
