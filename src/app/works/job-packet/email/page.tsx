            <p>Hello Dhishan,</p> <br /><p>How have you been?</p> <p>I really enjoyed my time interning under you at Bloomberg in the summer of 2024, working on Skyline/Atlas</p>
            <br /> <p>I am writing this email to ask if you would be willing to be my references and/or write a letter of reference for me when applying for future internship roles. We discussed my interest in game development, and your references would be a great support for me in exploring this field.
            </p> <br /> <p>Thank you for your time, Aaron James </p>
