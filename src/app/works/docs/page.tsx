                <p>For this project, I contributed the technical/system documentation slides as well as the frequently asked questions slides. I also contributed by making the group chat to communicate and by coming to a final decision for our item</p>
                <br />
                <p>Regarding learning objectives, I worked towards number 4, by collaborating with my group to work on the project. I also experienced number 5, analyzing the difference between system and user documentation, what was expected of each type, and what helped each type the most. A multimodal composition of images and text was used in both our technical specs and user guide to better explain the product to both theoretical users and theoretical collaborators. I also practiced number 8, finding sources for information on the product and ensuring all sources were properly cited.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>My group had a lot of challenges. No one (including me) really wanted to take charge or be forceful. No one was attached to an idea, so we talked about what items we didn’t want and put the rest on a wheel to choose from. The group chat didn’t get used beyond the first day. In the end, we finished the slides and had a presentation despite the lack of communication.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>Some takeaways I had is that someone needs to step up in a group and that I need to try to be more confident. I also realized how hard writing detailed documentation is, and it’s not something I look forward to as a developer. I also sort of realize why icebreakers are used in groups/teams, being awkward or nervous makes communication hard and decreases efficiency.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>In conclusion, this project was useful for me because I was recently chosen as team lead for a BYTE club team, and I hope I can leverage this experience to ensure that my team runs efficiently and meets its deadlines.
